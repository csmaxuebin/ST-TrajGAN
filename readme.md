The rapid development of location-based services(LBS) exposes large-scale trajectory data to the risk of privacy leakage. In order to enhance the trajectory privacy protection while improving the trajectory utility, this paper proposes an efficient and secure deep learning model ST-TrajGAN (Semantic and Transformer-based Trajectory Generative Adversarial Networks) for trajectory data generation and publication. First, a semantic trajectory encoding model is introduced to preprocess the trajectory points. Second, a synthetic trajectory with more uncertainty and practicality is generated by learning the spatial-temporal and semantic features of real trajectory data. In addition, a new TrajLoss loss metric function is designed to measure the trajectory similarity loss of the trained deep learning model. Finally, the effectiveness of the generated synthetic trajectories and the utility of the model is evaluated by TUL and TSP values on the real LBS datasets.

## Datasets

```
- Foursquare NYC, Geolife, Gowalla datasets
```

## Experimental Setup

### Hyperparameters

 -  epochs = 5000
 - learning rate = 0.001
 - batch size = 256
 ### Evaluation Metrics：
- Privacy Evaluation
-Trajectory-User Linking (TUL)：A smaller TUL value indicates a higher level of difficulty in linking users, signifying enhanced - privacy for trajectories
- Utility Evaluation
-Hausdorff distance（HDD）：The Hausdorff distance serves as a metric for quantifying the distance between two sets and is commonly utilized to assess the spatial dissimilarity between two trajectories.
-Trajectory sharing percentage（TSP）：The Trajectory Sharing Percentage is a metric that measures the similarity between synthetic and corresponding real trajectories by averaging the similarity scores across all pairs. A higher TSP signifies a closer match between the synthetic and actual trajectory data, indicating the effectiveness of the synthetic data in mirroring real-world patterns.
-Frequency distribution of visits

## Experimental Results

A smaller TUL value indicates a higher level of difficulty in linking users, signifying enhanced privacy for trajectories.

The visualization in Fig. 5 illustrates the Hausdorff distances, revealing a decreasing trend for each model as the number of training iterations increases across the three datasets.
